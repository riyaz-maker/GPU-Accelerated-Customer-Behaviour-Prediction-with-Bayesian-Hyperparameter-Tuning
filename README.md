# GPU-Accelerated-Customer-Behaviour-Prediction-with-Bayesian-Hyperparameter-Tuning
This project implements a time series-based customer behavior prediction model using LSTM neural networks. The model leverages GPU acceleration and Bayesian optimization (via Optuna) for hyperparameter tuning.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Predict customer behavior using time series data.
- **Tech Stack**: TensorFlow, Optuna, Python.
- **Optimization**: Hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian optimization.
  
## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a time series dataset "eCommerce behavior data from multi category store" from kaggle.
